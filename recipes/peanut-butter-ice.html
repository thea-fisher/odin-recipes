        A fresh and colourful, high protein chicken salad for two, 
        perfect as a relaxed summer lunch or packed into a picnic. By chopping all the ingredients into bite-size pieces, 
        every mouthful becomes a different mix of flavours and textures.

        For a healthier version of this chicken salad, you can swap the mayonnaise for plain yoghurt.
        You can cook the chicken from fresh but it also works brilliantly with leftovers from a roast.
        Each serving provides 633 kcal, 68.3g protein, 25.3g carbohydrate (of which 6.1g sugars), 26.4g fat (of which 2.9g saturates),
