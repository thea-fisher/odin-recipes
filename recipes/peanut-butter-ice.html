     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

     <ul>
         <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
         <li>1 lime - juiced</li>
         <li>1 garlic clove - minced</li>
         <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
         <li>4 tbsp powdered peanut butter</li>
         <li>2 tbsp water</li>
         <li>1 tbsp sugar free maple syrup</li>
         <li>200g wholewheat noodles - cooked</li>
         <li>Half a red cabbage</li>
         <li>2 carrots - cut into strips</li>
         <li>Chopped spring onions and peanuts</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps:</h3>

     <ol>
         <li>First make the dressing by adding the soy sauce, lime juice, crushed garlic, grated ginger, 
            powdered peanut butter, water, and Sugar-Free Syrup to a small bowl and stirring well to combine. 
            Divide up into 4 small dressing containers and set aside.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, add the cooked & drained noodles to a large bowl along with the shredded red cabbage and finely chopped carrots. 
            Mix together to evenly combine all 3 ingredients together - 
            you may want to use tongs to help you do this rather than a spoon.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the noodle mix between 4 containers and along with a pot of dressing in each. Garnish with chopped spring onions and peanuts
